# Code-Refactor-01
Code Refactor Exercise


## Description

Exercise to take existing code and refactor it to meet a set of standards and make it accessible. 

The intention is to leave the code editing cleaner than found. 

Code/content/images provided- just refactoring as exercise and practice. CSS selectors/properties not consolidated in css styling in this exercise (focus on HTML readability and semantics). However, some comments added for opportunities to simplify.

Comments note changes and descriptions.

## Example Story

Exercise Requirements/Goals: 

Marketing agency requests code base that follows standards for the site...

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
